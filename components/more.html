         <div><h4>"The Startup of You" by Reid Hoffman - (January 17rd, 2017).</h4>  
        <p>
         The startup of you has been a revealing book; it has mad eme look at my life in a different way: as a startup. Four of the biggest takeaways that I learned from this book are: 
1- First, to invest in myself fast. There are many ways I can invest in myself: by reading books, taking classes, networking, among many others. As the saying goes "knowledge is power"; and in this versatile society that is in constant change and chaos, those who have more knowledge and connections are better equipped to succeed. After reading this chapter, I started a new daily routine:  before I attempt to do any school work every day, I must first work on the goals that matter to me the most and have a high return on my investment such as studying for coding interviews, learning NodeJs, reading 30 pages a day and working out. So far this habit hasn’t impacted my school performance whatsoever, it has just made me more efficient. 2- Second, to have a plan ABZ plan because as a startup, I must have a mitigation strategy and a contingency plan, so that surprises don’t catch me off guard and I’m able to pivot quickly. 3- Third, o take smart risks. The more “smart” I’m exposed to, the more resilient I will become to drastic changes in my life. I should not overestimate risks and threats; I should always ask myself this question: “What’s the worst thing that could happen?” If you think about it, it’s not as bad as our minds perceive it. 4- Fourth, to nurture my network. My network is an incredible value source of information that I can tap into at any given moment. I should foster and take care of the people I know; send them “small gifts” such as articles or information they will appreciate. Reid Hoffman’s calls this  I to the power of we. I must expand my network: get involved in “meetup” communities and side projects. The more experiences I have the more aware I will be about trends and potential opportunities, which will give me a competitive advantage over others.

      <div><h4>"The Tipping Point" by Malcolm Gladwell - (September 30th, 2016).</h4>  
        <p>
          This is an amazing book that has taught me a lot about how epidemics occur. I would say this is a must-read book for anyone interested in learning about the factors that make trends become viral only through word-of-mouth. 
Similarly, I have learned how important is to become “a connector,” someone who is part of different social groups and is able to connect members of these different groups. A connector has a wider perspective about society than anyone else does. 
Gladwell has also answered a question I had always been pondering about: Why didn't I become addicted to nicotine while my closest high school friends did? I started smoking cigarettes when I was attending a boarding high school in Havana and this habit incentivized  throughout my time in the army. However, I never became dependent on cigarretes. Why? Based on Gladwell's insights, my nicotine consumption was much lower than my friends’; it never surpassed the “threshold” that would make me dependent on it. That’s why I never became addicted to cigarettes and haven't smoked them since I left the army.
