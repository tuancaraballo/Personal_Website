       <p> My name is Antuan(Tuan). I'm a Computer Science major at Stanford University (2018) pursuing a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). </p>

       <p>I'm passionate about the study of philanthropy and its application, particularly in finding the most effective ways to give. I currently serve on the Student Advisory Board of Giving Circles Fund, an organization led by <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Arrillaga-Andreessen" >Laura Arrillaga. </a> </p> 
       
       <p> 
       I'm also an enthusiast of technology. I'm deeply interested in learning about how technology can improve the lives of those in post-Communist economies. I aspire to turn my knowledge and skills into opportunities for my people in my home country, Cuba. </p>
 
       <p>
       Fun fact about me: I'm a funny salsa (and reguetton) dancer :-) -a serum all Cuban babies receive when they are born :-) -. </p>
