      My name is Tuan Anh Tran Caraballo. I'm an enthusiastic of Technology. I'm deeply interested in learning how technology can improve the lives of those in post-Communist economies.<br>

       I'm also a Computer Science major at Stanford University, CA. I'm pursing a concentration in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I'm graduating in 2018. <br> 

      Being from Cuba, I consider myself to be a pretty cool salsa and reguetton dancer :-) -a serum all Cuban babies receive when they are born :-) -.
    
      I aspire to turn my knowldge and skills into opportunities for my people in my home country. I intend to go back to support young entreprenerus who are already challenging the status quo and making a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.
