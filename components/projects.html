  			<h5 class="projectTitle"> <strong> Project | 01 Heap Allocator </strong> <h5/>

        <ul style="max-width: 90%">
          <li class="projectListItem">
             This is the final project for the popular course CS107, taught at Stanford. I built a heap allocator by implementing the functions malloc, free, and realloc.
          </li>
          
          <li class="projectListItem">
              I designed the allocator using segregated linked lists of free memory. I divided free blocks into three group sizes: small, medium and large, and stored them in a table, creating a dynamic design. When memory was requested, the allocator would first check the cached free blocks before extending the heap. If a cached block was bigger than the requested size, the allocator would split the block, if possible, coalescing the separated free block with other free neighbors before adding it to the freed table.
          </li>   
          
          <li class="projectListItem">
              Each free block contained a header and a footer structure to store size and status. This way, the allocator knew the exact location of the contiguous neighboring blocks before coalescing them.
          </li>  

           <li class="projectListItem">
              One of the most important lessons I learned on this project was how the heap works. Similarly, I developed a strong foundation on the use of pointers and pointer arithmetic.I would say, however, that the most valuable lesson I learned was paying attention to small details and staying consistent with my code. To accomplish this, I focused on designing my program on paper first. Then, I tested the code as I progressed in small steps, so that I could consider edge cases and built a robust program. This has been one of the most challenging, yet most rewarding project I have worked on.

       <ul>
          <li class="projectListItem">
              I built a Task Manager for Android named Unagi. I developed this app while at an Android BootCamp at Twitter headquarters (Thank you very much, Twitter!). Unagi's purpose is to help individuals stays productive with the help of a social twist.

          <li class="projectListItem">
              Whenever the user posts a task, this gets posted to his or her Twitter account, holding the person accountable for it. When the task is either finished or not completed on time, the app posts to the user's Twitter. There is no option to delete tasks.
          </li> 
   
          <li class="projectListItem">
              I used Twitter's Fabric API for the login portion as well as for the posting. Similarly, for the list of activities I used RecyclerView instead of ListView.
