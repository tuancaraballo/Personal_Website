        <p> Being from Cuba, I consider myself to be a pretty cool salsa and reguetton dancer :-) -a serum all Cuban babies receive when they are born :-) -. I aspire to turn my knowldge and skills into opportunities for my people in my home country. I intend to go back to support young entreprenerus who are already challenging the status quo and making a difference in the lives of those less fortunate.
